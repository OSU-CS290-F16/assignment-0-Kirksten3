# Assignment 0
**Due at 4:59pm on Monday, 9/26/2016**

Name: `Kirk Stennett`

ONID ID: `931775870`

Link to my CS 290 page: `http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~stennetk/cs290/`

This assignment is intended to get you up and running with some of the tools we'll be using in this course and also to get you to start using HTML.  It should be very straightforward.  It has two parts.

## 1. Sign up for Piazza

Use this link to sign up for CS 290 on Piazza using your ONID email address: https://piazza.com/oregonstate/fall2016/cs290

We'll be using Piazza in this course for Q&A because it's geared towards students helping other students with the class.  Anyone can post or answer a question on Piazza, even anonymously, and the instructor and TAs can revise and endorse student answers, which means you can be confident in the quality of the response.

You are *strongly encouraged* to post any class-related querstions to Piazza first instead of emailing the instructor or TAs.  You should also get in the habit of checking in to Piazza to answer other students' questions.  This will not only enable everyone to get help quickly, but it will also help you improve your understanding of the material, since teaching someone else is the best way to learn something.

As an incentive to use Piazza, extra credit will be awarded to the most active Piazza participants at the end of the class.

## 2. Use Git and GitHub and start practicing HTML

The other tool we'll be using quite a bit for this course is Git/GitHub.  You're already here looking at this assignment, so we know you've got at least some Git/GitHub skills.  Practice a little more and also start using HTML by following these steps:

1. If you're new to Git and GitHub, take a few minutes to follow these two tutorials:
  * Git: https://try.github.io/
  * GitHub: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

  We'll be using Git and GitHub heavily in this course, so it'll pay off to put in the time now to learn how to use them.

2. Commit and push a change to this `README.md` file in which you replace `NAME` and `ONID_ID` above with your actual name and ONID ID.

3. Add, commit, and push a new file `index.html` that contains a complete HTML-only page (no CSS or JS yet) that displays these things:
  * Your name and what you prefer to be called (if it's different).
  * Your major and year of study.
  * Thge answer to this question: on a scale from 0 (I've never even seen HTML code) to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how confident are you in your web development skills.
  * The answer to this question: what do you hope to learn from this class?
  * The answer to this question: have you signed up for Piazza?
  * A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.  Include only what you can think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.
  * A photo with a clear picture of your face (using an `<img>` tag).

  This info should be well-structured, e.g. using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.), an unordered list (`<ul>` and `<li>`), a combination of those things, or anything else that makes sense.

4. Add, commit, and push a new file `blog.html` that contains an HTML-only page (for now) that will contain your code blog for the whole term.  In this file, you should start your code blog with a single entry reflecting on your experience doing this assignment.  Here are some example questions you might answer:
  * What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment.  How did you solve them?
  * What did you learn from this assignment?  What did you already know?
  * What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?  How did you use these resources?

  Your blog page should be nicely structured, with a title at the top and a title and date for your first post.

5. Commit and push an update to your `index.html` file adding a link near the top of the page to your code blog.

6. Publish your index and blog pages under your personal ENGR web space (or ONID, if you're not an Engineering student) under a URL like this: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~YOUR_ONID_ID/cs290/.  For help publishing to your web space, see one of these pages:
  * ENGR: http://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/where-do-i-put-my-personal-webpages
  * ONID: http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/accounts/onid-osu-network-id/using-your-onid/publishing-your-website

7. Commit and push a change to this `README.md` file replacing `CS290_PAGE_URL` above with a URL to your published CS 290 page.

## Submission

Submit the assignment via GitHub Classroom by the due date above.

## Grading criteria

The assignment is worth 100 total points, broken down as follows:
* 40 points: Signed up for Piazza
* 60 points: Followed the instructions for using Git/GitHub and practicing HTML
  * 10 points: Updated `README.md` with the right info
  * 30 points: Added `index.html` and `blog.html` with the requested structure and content
  * 20 points: Published `index.html` and `blog.html` to your ENGR or ONID web space

In addition to your programming assignment grade, you will recieve a pass/fail grade for your code blog entry, included in the code blog portion of your grade.
