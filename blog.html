    <h4>Week 1, Assignment 0 - 9/26/16</h4>
    <p>The only trouble I encountered was trying to accept the assignment on my GitHub account. 
    What I didn't realize was that you had to use your school email as the primary to accept. I switched it back after that.
    </p>
    <p>I already knew everything that this assignment required.</p>
    <p>I didn't use any resources in doing this assignment, it is extremely simple HTML</p>
